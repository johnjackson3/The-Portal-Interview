I chose objects first and put them in lists. The objects would be able to hold all the necessary data in it's data members. I could manipulate that object as I saw fit. I put all the objects necessary into a list in order to compare them to each other in a double for loop. I used military time as the times because it's easier to compare the values with 0-24 instead of 1-12 and 12-1. I used a double for loop for comparisons and added the names of the overlapped events to a new list.A possible edge case was an event that was the same as another. It could confuse the output or possibly put too many or too little names in the returned list of overlapped events. The same for the double for loop. I was sure to check both event names to avoid this, and I checked each individual property of the Dates class except the end time in order to be sure. Another case was the times that included half hours. They may have disrupted the check between the two events, so I used military time and decimals to get around this.
